Simple WordPress plugin that saves new and edited posts to the Wayback Machine. More functionality coming soon.

== Description ==
Do you value what you create? Are you sure that your backups work properly? Wouldn't another safety measure be great, especially if it was enabled with just one click?

<a href="https://web.archive.org">Wayback Machine</a> saves the Web, and we can ask it to save your site as well. Every time you publish a new post or edit an existing one, Wayback Machine will save your new page.

== Changelog ==
= 1.0 - 2020-03-05 =
* Added: save new and edited post to Wayback Machine
